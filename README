git-hitlist [--cached]
git-hitlist <commit> [<commit>]

Open vim with all the files touched by the unstaged changes, staged changes
(with --cached), or the specified commit.  If two commits are specified, the
diff of the two will be used.  The quickfix list is populated with the first
line of each patch hunk for easier jumping around.

--cached    Use staged changes instead of unstaged changes
